Things have been really busy for Tessera this past year. In this post you'll hear aobut what we've been up to (with some poor excuses for not keeping up on our blog) and some of the plans we have for this upcoming year.

### What we did in 2015

#### Talks

A major theme for 2015 was traveling and giving talks.  We gave over 20 talks / tutorials / courses over the course of the year.  We were fortunate enough to be able to speak at three of the major R meetups: San Francisco, New York, and Seattle, and spread the word abroad with a tutorial at useR! in Denmark, a talk at an R HPC Workshop in Tokyo, and a full-day short course in Sydney Australia.  We are very grateful to all of our hosts and attendees.  See the end of this post for a full listing of our activity with links to the talks / course material.

#### Development

From the development side, we have continued to push out regular updates and bug fixes to datadr, Trelliscope, and RHIPE.  A new addition this year is the [rbokeh](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/) plotting library.  While this package is not a direct dependency for Tessera, it is particularly useful in Trelliscope displays as it removes the need for R to render plots on the fly when viewing a display (more on this in plans for 2016) and provides simple interactivity within panels of a display with no additional effort.  We have also begun some new Tessera enhancements that we will discuss below.

#### Application & Methodology

In addition to speaking and development, a great deal of our time has been spent on application and methodology.  As part of the DARPA XDATA program, we have been doing deep analysis of NYC taxi data and a very large collection of high-frequency finance data.  In an upcoming post we will share an example of a one-million panel Trelliscope display we created for this data.  At Purdue, a major project has been an in-depth cyber security analysis of a 5.7 TB collection of Spamhaus blacklist data, with some exciting discoveries.  There are also many interesting applications going on at PNNL.  Ryan has also been busy applying Tessera tools to analysis and visualization of child health data for the Gates Foundation.

At Purdue, research continues on many methodological aspects of Divide and Recombine, including MCMC for likelihood and bayesian inference, spatio-temporal analysis, and time series parameter estimation.

All in all, given the amount of development, application work, travel, and presentation preparation, very little time has been left for posting on our blog and engaging through social media, but we aim to do a better job in 2016.

### Plans for 2016

Speaking of 2016, we have many plans, including:

#### CRAN

The datadr and Trelliscope packages have matured enough that we are now working toward getting them on CRAN (which has proven difficult due to some of the optional system-level dependencies that the packages depend on).  We hope this will help us track our user base better and make it easier for people to install.

#### TrelliscopeJS

We have been working on a new project, "TrelliscopeJS" with the aim of building a back-end agnostic pure javascript Trelliscope viewer using React and graphql.  Part of this is a redesign of the user interface that will make things much more intuitive to the user.  The move to React will allow for much faster development and addition of features.  Also, the design should allow for Trellisope displays to be created or served from other languages (like Python), although our implementation will still be for R.  This will also open up the possibility of serving stand-alone serverless Trellsicope displays (in the case of pre-rendering all the panels with something like rbokeh) that can be shared on a simple web server, as a simple directory of files, or on github.  The hope is that TrelliscopeJS will drop in without much change to the current trellsicope package.

#### Spark

For datadr, we plan to work toward implementing a Spark back-end.  We were well on the way to this this year until the SparkR package removed support for the Spark API in favor of a simplified data frame interface.  We will investigate reviving this work or making our own Spark / R connector.

#### And more!

The speaking and tutorial schedule doesn't show signs of letting up, we continue to work on interesting applications, and we're sure many new development and methodology ideas will come up in the process.  We are looking forward to a great year in 2016.
