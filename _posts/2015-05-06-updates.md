We have been very busy pushing several udpates to datadr, trelliscope, and RHIPE, updating our documentation generation system, and pushing out new cluster installation manuals.

### Code Updates ###

Most of the datadr/trelliscope udpates have to do with better stability when running with Hadoop or local disk as the back end, as well as documentation cleanup and unit tests.  A few minor user-facing changes have been made in datadr that are worth quickly noting:

- New convenience function `kvPair()` to explicitly specify and create a key-value pair
- New `drPersist()` method to make transformations persistent on the back end (similar to calling `recombine` with a `combDdo` combiner)
- New logic for how transformations are handled - the output will always be treated as a value unless the return is specified explicitly as `kvPair()`
- The first argument of `drAggregate()` is now the data instead of the formula to be consistent with other methods and to allow for data to be piped in

RHIPE has also been receiving updates mostly having to do with properly using s3 storage as input/output for EMR Hadoop jobs.  We will post examples of how to use our EMR scripts in the future.

### Cluster Installation Manuals ###

In addition to code updates, the Tessera team at Purdue has put together [extensive documentation](http://tessera.io/docs-install-cluster/) for installing Tessera on your own cluster.  While we have provided several resources for configuration-less solutions for getting your hands on back ends like Hadoop, such as [Vagrant](https://github.com/tesseradata/install-vagrant) and [EMR](https://github.com/tesseradata/install-emr) scripts, often you want to work on your own in-house cluster, and these manuals will help with that.

### New Documentation System ###

Finally, we have updated the documentation generation mechanism for our package documentation.  We are now using an R package, [packagedocs](https://github.com/hafen/packagedocs) to generate the pages.  This package is basically an [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) template coupled with [staticdocs](https://github.com/hadley/staticdocs)-like functionality (it actually uses staticdocs behind the scenes).  The previous documentation system was getting a bit complex and dated and was not able to handle new features provided by rmarkdown, such as being able to embed htmlwidgets, etc.  While this package was designed with package documentation in mind, its rmarkdown template can be used for any purpose.

Another nice addition as we've migrated to packagedocs is that we've taken what was before a table of contents listing a long alphabetical list of all the functions available in the package and categorized and ordered the list in a way that should help navigate the help pages with a better understanding of where functions belong and their context.

Documentation pages recently re-generated with packagedocs include:

- [datadr](http://tessera.io/docs-datadr/)
- [trelliscope](http://tessera.io/docs-trelliscope/)
- [rbokeh](http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/)
