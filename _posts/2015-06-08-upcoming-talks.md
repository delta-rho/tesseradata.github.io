We have several talks and tutorials coming up that have been keeping us busy.

The PNNL team and Ryan Hafen will be presenting and giving a tutorial at the HSARPA Big Data Series on Data Visualization in Washington, D.C. on June 10.  We will post a follow up on Ryan's talk after the event.

On June 11-12, we will be involved in much of the program at the [Interface Symposium](https://interface-symposium.squarespace.com/program/) in Morgantown, West Virginia.

Bill Cleveland will give the keynote address on June 11, *[Divide & Recombine with Tessera: Analyzing Larger and More Complex Data](http://www.stat.wvu.edu/~jharner/Interface2015Abstracts/ClevelandAbstract.pdf)*.

On June 12, the PNNL team and Ryan Hafen will give [tutorials on Tessera](http://www.stat.wvu.edu/~jharner/Interface2015Abstracts/WhiteTutorialAbstract.pdf).

In the afternoon Bill Cleveland, Doug Crabill, and Ryan Hafen will speak in an invited session on *[A Designed Experiment on Effects of Dataset, Hadoop, and Hardware Factors on D&R Computational Performance](http://www.stat.wvu.edu/~jharner/Interface2015Abstracts/ClevelandCrabillAbstract.pdf)* and *[Interface, Design, and Computational Considerations for D&R](http://www.stat.wvu.edu/~jharner/Interface2015Abstracts/HafenAbstract.pdf)*.
